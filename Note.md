# Hello IEC

I am very happy to take this test.  
I have some ideas:

- I worked with the team and maintained the code for Viettel. So my goal is to limit other people's code writing.
- I always respect everyone's way of coding, but in my opinion, the project can create a mono item object and can reuse it with Pool.

## In Test Code #1

I made a mistake by not recording a video of the process. I did not read the entire incoming message carefully.

## Essay Number 2

I think I did not fully understand the request.

**Thanks for reading, I look forward to hearing from you.**
